				Despite this car is cheap, it has a lot of safety options. Let's consider
				three main types of them.

		<div class="safetyMain" style="margin-top: 10px;">

				<h3>Helpers during driving</h3>
				<p></p>
				<img src="driveSafety.jpg" style="width: 90%;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px;">
				<p class="interiordP">The main part of safety system during driving is driver help system. It's is complex of line, brake assistants adaptive cruise control and road signs recogntition. This system will help you to drive carefully, because computer can help or warn driver during or before emergency. You can also buy individual components of this system.</p><p class="interiordP">
				In addition to that, you can buy adaptive light pack, which will help you to help illuminate the road without blinding other drivers. Also we recommend to buy head-up display which shows you current speed, engine speed and navigation guides.</p>

			</div>
			<div> 
				<h4>Helpers during parking</h4>
			<img src="360camera.jpg" style="width: 90%;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px;">
				<p class="interiordP"> 
					Parking is also important part in driver's life. On the one hand, it's difficult to get into serious car accident during parking, but on the other hand - even simple accident can empty your wallet. To avoid car accident we also offer different systems: parctronics - sensor which warn driver when car's front or back is too close to other object, parking camera - camera which activates when driver turn reverce mode on and draws car path on the display by lines. This module is very helpful during parking, especially in narrow places like filled parking lot or garage. Also you can buy 360 degrees camera. In addition to that, this camera allows driver to see all objects around car.
				</p>

				<h4>Other things to save driver's and passenger's life </h4>
				<img src="energiserSafety.jpg" style="width: 90%;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px;">
				<p class="interiodP">
					But no matter how perfect the car is, the most important safety factor remains the driver, namely his attention and speed of reaction, which decreases due to fatigue. Therefore, we recommend that you buy Energizer - an intelligent system that will monitor the condition of the driver through a special bracelet and try to cheer him up by manipulating the volume of music, temperature in the cabin and ionized air.
